# RobCo-Terminal
A Fallout, RobCo style terminal emulator (like) script for python3. 

Welcome to the ROBCO INDUSTRIES (TM) TERMLINK! This terminal emulator is inspired by the iconic terminals from the Fallout series of video games. This application allows you to manage passwords, usernames, view system logs, handle error directories, manage security, perform hacking activities, and view entry logs with a vintage terminal script.

I recommend using 'Cool-Retro-Term', terminal emulator by: Swordfish90 https://github.com/Swordfish90/cool-retro-term/tree/1.2.0

The centre of the screen for the script is set in the 'Terminal.py' file line: ~173.
The current centerLine is set to 95, this is because that's the size of my CRT display.
This script was made for Raspberry Pi OS, so this will indeed work on Raspberry Pi, Mac/Apple, and Linux. Windows is currently in development.

The logon is set to 'admin' with the password being '1234', these can be changed in the settings section of the admin-terminal menu. 

## Key Features

- **User Management**: View and change passwords, usernames, credentials, and authorisation.
- **System Log**: Logs every move you make so you are able to view what exactly you did at anytime, you can also reset the system log.
- **Error Directory**: Display a list of error codes from the fallout series.
- **Security Management**: Manage security settings and security logs.
- **Hacking Interface**: Simulate hacking attempts with fallouts retro-style interface.
- **Entry Logs**: View, create and clear entry logs just as you would in fallout.
- **Help Menu**: Get instructions and information about using the terminal.
- **Exit**: Safely exit the terminal application.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/TrickyTaco11/RobCo-Terminal.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```
   path/to/RobCo-Terminal-4.0
   ```
3. **Run the terminal application**:
   ```
   python3 terminal.py
   ```

## Usage

Upon running the script, you will be in a small section of the terminal where simple commands (still in progress) can be prompted... type 'help' for a list of commands (some may not function correctly). You can login on that same command line, once authenticated, you can navigate through various menus to manage entries, a custom missile silo inventory system, usernames, passwords, system logs, a normal terminal function, security settings, and perform hacking activities.

The custom missile system is a .txt file (!!still in development!!) with a graph of missile silo inventories for each countries, all data is recieved from: : https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/missiles
This is there just for aesthetics, not functional in anyway except for viewing different missile variants in specified countries (all public information).

### Notes

- The terminal interface is designed to replicate the feel of the Fallout 3 & 4 computer-terminal systems.
- Saves are automatic once the file has been created. eg/: if you write an entry; you just have to finish writing in it and press 'enter' for it to save automatically. If your computer turns off during writing or the scirpt is cancelled, there may be a possibility that the file may not be upto date, or written at all.
- This is a work in progress, I am not an experienced programmer. I was simply doing this for fun since I owned an old CRT display and wanted to create a Fallout Series terminal.
- There are still some bugs and 'IN PROGRESS' sections to this project, the code may not be the fanciest but it works for the time being, I will clean up the code for every major version released.
