After, you will be prompted with a basic terminal.

In this basic terminal you can logon to the main admin terminal via prompting: 'logon (username)', this will then ask you for your password displayed 
in hashes(*).

After you have logged in you will be sent to the 'Admin Portal'. This is where you can access entry logs, settings, security, your regular OS-Terminal, system-logs, and a lot more.

I will show you an example of using the terminal Entry Log; this works the same for the Data Archive, Security Logs and Emergency Protocols.
In each of these you can, create, view and clear different terminal entries.
