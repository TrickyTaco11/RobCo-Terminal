In this basic terminal you can logon to the main admin terminal via prompting: 'logon (username)', this will then ask you for your password displayed 
in hashes(*).

After you have logged in you will be sent to the 'Admin Portal'. This is where you can access entry logs, settings, security, your regular OS-Terminal, system-logs, and a lot more.

I will show you an example of using the terminal Entry Log; this works the same for the Data Archive, Security Logs and Emergency Protocols.
In each of these you can, create, view and clear different terminal entries.

***Entry Log***
This is the entry log main page, here you can access all the different options.

***Add Entry***
You will be asked for a title for your entry, followed by the actual entry you wish to create. This will save as a .txt file in the journal_entries directory.
